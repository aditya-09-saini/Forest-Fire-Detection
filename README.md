# Forest-Fire-Detection
The aim of this project is to detect fires in forests using Deep Learning. 

Fires in forests leads to loss of natural resources as well as destruction of habitats for animals. So it is necessary to identify fires at early stages so that necessary measures can be taken to control them.

In this project, Deep Learning is used to train a model to detect whether there is fire in a forest or not. For this purpose, a model has been trained. It is a classification problem which gives 'Fire' or 'No Fire' as the output. It uses Convonutional Neural Networks (CNN) which are generally used for images and videos.
